    <span class="lead">The Mini-MegaTORTORA</span> (MMT-9) system is an unique multi-purpose wide-field monitoring instrument built for and owned by the Kazan Federal University, presently operated under an agreement between Kazan Federal University and Special Astrophysical Observatory, Russia.
  </p>

  <p>
    It includes a set of nine individual channels installed in pairs on five equatorial mounts. Every channel has a celostate mirror installed before the Canon EF85/1.2 objective for a rapid (faster than 1 second) adjusting of the objective direction in a limited range (approximately 10 degrees to any direction). This allows for either mosaicking the larger field of view, or for pointing all the channels in one direction. In the latter regime, a set of color (Johnson's B, V or R) and polarimetric (three different directions) filters may be inserted before the objective to maximize the information acquired for the observed region of the sky (performing both three-color photometry and polarimetry).
  </p>

  <p>
    The channels are equipped with an Andor Neo sCMOS detector having 2560x2160 pixels 6.4um each. Field of view of a channel is roughly 9x11 degrees with angular resolution of roughly 16'' per pixel. The detector is able to operate with exposure times as small as 0.03 s, in our work we use 0.1 s exposures providing us with 10 frames per second.

  <p>
    The Mini-MegaTORTORA (MMT) instrument is operational since Jun 2014. This archive presents the subset of data it acquired in a wide-field "deep survey" regime, mostly using exposures of 20 to 60 seconds in a white light (the complete Mini-MegaTORTORA data, including archives of detected meteors, satellites etc, is available <a href="http://mmt.favor2.info">here</a>).

    Archive covers nights from <a href="{% url 'images' %}?night={{ nights.min }}">{{ nights.min }}</a> till <a href="{% url 'images' %}?night={{ nights.max }}">{{ nights.max }}</a>, and has <a href="{% url 'images' %}">{{ nights.count }}</a> images in total.
